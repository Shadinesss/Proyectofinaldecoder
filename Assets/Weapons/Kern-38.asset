  weaponDescription: The Kern-38 assault rifle is a powerful semi-automatic rifle
    with two firing modes. One mode is electronically powered through the connection
    with the protective suit of White-X's elite soldiers. The other mode is available
    in case of a suit battery failure, allowing for a lower recoil automatic fire
    propelled by gunpowder. The user can switch between both types of fire at will.
